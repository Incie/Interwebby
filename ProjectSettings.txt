This file contains a summary of changed project settings


Memory leaks tracked with VLD (Visual Leak Detector), and is enabled by preprocessor defines in Entry.cpp.


Notable OS [Windows] Setup:
I have one directory where I put SDKs. I have a dedicated SDK folder in my Project collection. 
This is where I extract and compile external libraries like wxWidgets.
I created an environmentvariable called SDK_PATH which points to [Drive]:\Projects\SDK\

This environmentvariable is there to enable easier sharing of project between machines.
